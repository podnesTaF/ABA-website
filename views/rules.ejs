                  Competitions are team competitions. 2 teams of five athletes each
                  go to the start of the race. The distance that has to be reached
                  is a mile, which in numbers equals 1609 meters and 34 centimeters.
                  According to the approved chip system, the time of each athlete is
                  recorded every 200 meters, and the results in live mode are
                  displayed on the information panels, which show the total time of
                  each team and the difference between them in a specific time
                  period. This allows the team to control their position and quickly
                  start a tactical exit to remoteness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most interesting thing: each team has two spare participants,
                  the so-called "Jokers" (who are in the "corridor"), they have the
                  right to replace any member of their team once at any stage of the
                  distance for any segment, BUT up to the finish line
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team that shows the best combined time of all participants
                  will win! If the teams showed the same finish time to the
                  thousandth, the victory is won by the team whose representative
                  crossed the finish line first.

                 Amateur teams are formed without age groups and cannot be equipped
                 with participants who competed at the official starts of the
                 Athletics Federation of Ukraine at the level of the Ukrainian
                 Championships in the last 3 years.
